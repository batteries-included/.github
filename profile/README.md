We empower businesses to incubate, grow, scale, transform, observe, and manage what matters most to them rather than worrying about the minutia of DevOps, GitOps, or MLOps. 

Batteries Included is a company with a vision of an easier-to-use, friendlier, and more powerful software infrastructure platform in a box. We are building the all-inclusive platform for technology companies on top of Kubernetes, operating the best in open source with battle-tested tooling and insights built-in. There’s no YAML or new configuration language to learn; instead, powerful automation allows you to use cutting-edge machine learning, databases, networking, and security tools through a simple unified interface.
